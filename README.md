## What is it?
This is a flutter project. Basically this a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.
I made this for practice purpose.

The app is in "build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk". Another copy of that is in the root directory, "BMI.apk".
<!-- Haven't been tested from root directory file -->

You can download the app or use the code to make your own app.

### How it works?
1. Enter your height in any of the height parameters.
2. Enter your weight in any of the weight parameters.
3. Click on BMI button.

That's pretty much it. Enjoy!
